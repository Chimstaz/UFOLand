Game where you have to land your ship on dengerous terrain.
## Technologies
Game was written using imperative style in C. Some parts are using elements of C++ such as vectors and boost::chrono.
Used graphic library is Allegro 4.
## About style of code
Program was written between 2011-2014 so it started when I was in secondary school.
It was my first big project. Program is not well designed and need major refactor.
It has enough comments to understend but they are in Polish. 
Variabels have unconsistent names, some are in English where another are in Polish.
Somewhere in middle of high school I stopped developing it.
Code isn't buggy but is hard to maintain.
## Dependencies
- Allegro 4.2 (probably all 4.x will be ok)
- Boost (chrono module)
- OpenSSL (sha)
